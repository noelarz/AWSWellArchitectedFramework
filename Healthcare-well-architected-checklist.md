1)	Operational Excellence focuses on running and monitoring systems to deliver business value and continually improving processes and procedures.
- [ ] System Understanding: Define key healthcare application/workload components and their dependencies. Understand how to monitor the health of the system.
- [ ] Operations Procedures: Establish standard operating procedures for common and critical tasks including patient data management, system updates, and emergency procedures.
- [ ] Change Management: Implement a robust change management system to handle updates without disrupting patient care or violating regulatory standards.
- [ ] Resilience Testing: Test the system's ability to recover from failures, ensuring minimal disruption to healthcare services.
2)	Security is paramount in the healthcare industry due to the sensitive nature of data handled.
    a.	Data Protection: Implement strong encryption for stored and transmitted data. Comply with HIPAA and other relevant healthcare data protection regulations.
    b.	Access Control: Establish robust identity and access management protocols. Ensure only authorized individuals can access sensitive health data.
    c.	Threat Detection: Use AWS security tools to detect and manage threats promptly.
    d.	Security Incident Response: Have a well-defined and tested incident response plan.
3)	Reliability ensures the system's ability to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions.
    a.	High Availability: Design systems to be available across multiple AWS Availability Zones to ensure continuous access to healthcare applications.
    b.	Fault Tolerance: Use AWS services like Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing to build fault-tolerant applications.
    c.	Backup and Restore: Regularly backup critical data and test restoration procedures to prevent data loss.
4)	Performance Efficiency focuses on using IT and computing resources efficiently.
    a.	Resource Selection: Choose the right types of resources to meet workload requirements. This may include memory-optimized instances for data-intensive tasks or compute-optimized instances for processing-intensive tasks.
    b.	Monitoring: Use AWS CloudWatch and other tools to monitor performance and ensure the system meets healthcare workload demands.
    c.	Demand Management: Understand usage patterns and manage demand, ensuring the system can handle peak loads such as increased usage during flu season.
5)	Cost Optimization Avoid unnecessary costs and making the best use of AWS services.
    a.	Cost-Effective Resources: Use cost-effective resources that meet your needs. This could involve using reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for flexible workloads.
    b.	Matching Supply and Demand: Leverage auto-scaling to ensure you're not paying for unused resources.
    c.	Optimizing Over Time: Regularly review AWS usage and costs to find opportunities for savings.
6)	Sustainability Can be achieved through efficient use of resources and implementation of environmentally friendly practices.
    a.	Resource Optimization: Regularly review and optimize resource usage to reduce energy consumption and waste.
    b.	Environmental Impact: Consider the environmental impact of your infrastructure and strive to minimize it. Use AWS's sustainability dashboard to monitor carbon footprint.
    c.	Waste Reduction: Implement strategies to reduce electronic waste, such as efficient lifecycle management of hardware.
